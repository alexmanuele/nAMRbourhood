# nAMRbourhood

Very preliminary framework that hasn't even been installed/dummy run yet.

I decided to check out poetry for install etc as its meant to be replacing setuptools eventually.

See `nAMRbourhood/nAMRbourhood.py` for pseudocode/overview ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUNDg6yP9lo60-el7IJbtOxY6WLz7v5Ub4QuPbfBc0k/edit) for more details).
